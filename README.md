|                        | CRITERIA                                                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| __Set Up Pipeline__        | Create Github repository with project code                     | All project code is stored in a GitHub repository and a link to the repository has been provided for reviewers.                                                                                                    |
|                        | Use image repository to store Docker images                    | The project uses a centralized image repository to manage images built in the project. After a clean build, images are pushed to the repository.                                                                   |
| __Build Docker Container__ | Execute linting step in code pipeline                          | Code is checked against a linter as part of a Continuous Integration step (demonstrated w/ two screenshots).                                                                                                        |
|                        | Build a Docker container in a pipeline                         | The project takes a Dockerfile and creates a Docker container in the pipeline.                                                                                                                                     |
| __Successful Deployment__  | The Docker container is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster       | The cluster is deployed with CloudFormation or Ansible. This should be in the source code of the studentâ€™s submission.                                                                                             |
|                        | Use Blue/Green Deployment or a Rolling Deployment successfully | The project performs the correct steps to do a blue/green or a rolling deployment into the environment selected. Student demonstrates the successful completion of chosen deployment methodology with screenshots. |
